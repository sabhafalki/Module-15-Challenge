# Module-15-Challenge  MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to help the AutosRUs, new prototype,the MechaCar, by analysing the insights of production data provided by the manufacturing team. So, that they can progress the production.

The analysis consisted of the following:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. 
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
